# XRops

Code for Reproducibility and Review

This repository is intended for **code disclosure and reproducibility** purposes, rather than for directly running XRops in a production environment. If your goal is to simply use XRops, please visit [https://vience.io/xrops](https://vience.io/xrops) to review the documentation and get started with the application.

For hands-on experience, you can download the `.appx` package from the provided link and explore the demonstrations outlined in our publication, including **Demo1**, **Demo2**, **Demo3**, and **Demo4**.

This repository serves as a reference for those who wish to understand or reimplement the core functionalities discussed in the associated research. We encourage you to explore the code and accompanying resources to gain deeper insights into the project's underlying mechanisms.

Additionally, if you wish to run or deploy the server locally, we plan to release a **simple version** of the server with **Dockerization** in the near future. This will allow you to easily set up and operate the server environment.

We welcome **feedback** and **suggestions** for new features or improvements. Your contributions are highly appreciated.
